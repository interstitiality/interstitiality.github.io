	<h1>This is Lucas.</h1>
	<p>My name is Lucas Smith.  I don't live somewhere sexy like Brooklyn or the Bay Area: I call Norman, Oklahoma home.  But—and please take note—I can work remotely.  Right now, I handwrite small, static websites (often personal or small business sites) using Jekyll, and on occasion, I write simple programs in Python.  I also write a <a href="/blog">blog</a>, though infrequently and seldom pertaining to tech.  But future possibilities are seemingly endless.  If you'd like for me to write you something, I have a <a href="/freelance">freelance</a> page with details, or feel free to contact me directly about longer-term employment.  And thank you for visiting.</p>
